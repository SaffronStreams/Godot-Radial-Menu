# Godot-Radial-Menu
The very basics for making the basis of a radial menu in Godot, where you can select with the R-stick.

Currently something simple. Extends Node2D currently, but Control node probably makes more sense. 
Lacks any functionality to do with selections, contents to show in sections, etc.
